The goal of alabaster.sfe is to implement a language agnostic format to represent `SpatialFeatureExperiment` on disk, as in the [existing `alabaster` packages](https://github.com/orgs/ArtifactDB/repositories) from ArtifactDB. This serves to formalize and standardize the files written to disk when SFE reformats smFISH transcript spots and to improve interoperability between the R and Python implementations of Voyager.

## Installation

You can install the development version of alabaster.sfe from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("pachterlab/alabaster.sfe")
```

This package will be submitted to Bioconductor version 3.19 or 3.20.

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(alabaster.sfe)
## basic example code
```
